					<h4 class="accent mt-3">Activity Based Approach</h4>
					<p>The activity based approach is a continous system, It creates a closed loop during the requirements resolution allowing for greater exploration into problem resolution but like the phased based approach it makes the assumption that it’s only able to produce flawless results as a final output.</p>

					<p>The infinity approach assumes that a flawless solution is impossible. Unlike the phased & activity approaches It’s structure is appended to recyle all output back through the problem identifcation process. This approach ensures that a designers work is never complete, and the creation of a better solution is infinitly possible.</p>
